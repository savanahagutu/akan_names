> The website will require a user to fill out information about his date of birth and the century he was was born.
> The application calculates the day of the week the user was born and outputs it.
> One will be required to choose his gender and then click on the submit button in order to generate his/her Akan name.
> The application matches the day of the week with a specific Akan Name and outputs it to the user with a personalized message.
